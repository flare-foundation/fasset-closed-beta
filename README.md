## Install MySQL database with Docker

1. [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and install Docker Desktop.
2. Start the MySQL server as a Docker container `docker compose up -d` and keep it running every time you run the scenario.
3. Enter the MySQL as root with password root (default) and execute the `init.mysql.sql` file to create the `fassetbot` user and set permissions.
4.Set up the database `user` and `password` in the `secrets.json` by adding this block to the list and changing the password to the one you use.:
	```
	"database": {
	    "user": "fassetbot",
        "password": "my1beta2password3"

## First Time Setup

Follow the steps below to set up your local environment for the first time. If you have set the environment before, go to [Scenario Setup](#scenario-setup).

1. Clone the repository end and enter the folder
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flare-foundation/fasset-closed-beta.git
    cd fasset-closed-beta
    ```
2. If you don't have the `secrets.json` file set up, see [Secrets](#secrets) guide; otherwise, follow the next step;
3. Place your `secrets.json` file in the `fasset-closed-beta` folder under the name `secrets.json`;
4. Use these values in the `secrets.json` file for the `native_rpc` and `indexer` under the `apiKey` key:

    * `"native_rpc": "AavSehMLhcgz3crQHH5YJ3Rt8GMQGdV9aViGilADXGnTcjij"`
    * `"indexer": "123456"`

5. Obtain the API key via registering on Telegram - follow the [Telegram](#telegram) guide;
6. Go to [Agent Owner Registry](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0x746cBEAa5F4CAB057f70e10c2001b3137Ac223B7/write-contract#address-tabs) smart contract, connect via Metamask with your `management.address` from the `secrets.json`, and call `setWorkAddress` with your `secrets.owner.native.address` as an argument. Remember that this is a different smart contract from the official docs for the FAssets Open Beta.

## Scenario Setup

For each new scenario, follow the steps below:

1. Initialize repository:
    ```
    ./init.sh
    ```
2. Ensure that the configuration is correct and that the output is green.
    ```
    ./check.sh
    ```
3. Continue using the [Scenario Testing Tool](https://fasset-beta-simulator.flare.rocks/fasset-scenario) and join the scenario there.
4. If you need to answer some questions about the [Scenario Testing Tool](https://fasset-beta-simulator.flare.rocks/fasset-scenario), refer to this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QblHG_HLMsdE1YfJoZPXQIFhE4AYik-Xhk4Ux4M_jXo/edit?usp=sharing) or ask on Telegram from one of the Flare Developer Relations engineers.

## Additional Setup

### Secrets

If you do not have the `secrets.json` file, you should follow the below steps:

1. Make sure you came here from [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup),
2. Generate a management address - this is an EVM address that will control your agent for the duration of the closed/open beta,
3. Obtain `secrets.json` by running:
    ```
    ./gen-secrets.sh <management_address>
    ```
4. Fund your `secrets.owner.native.address` and `secrets.user.native.address` with some CFLR from the [this Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/), and some testXRP from the [this faucet](https://faucet.tequ.dev/).

3. Wait for us to confirm your registration info,
4. Run (send message) `/events`, click `Subscribe to Events`, and receive your API key.
